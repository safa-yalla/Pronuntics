# Pronuntics
Pronunciation Assessment with a ReactJS frontend and a Python backend connected with Flask API!
Have you ever been sure that you're pronouncing the word correctly, only to find out how wrong you were? Or are you a beginner taking their first steps towards pronouncing correctly? 

The aim is to use speech processing and Natural Language Processing to assess user’s pronunciation of the English vocabulary. The user can record their pronunciation of the word displayed on screen and the STT model can then check whether the pronunciation is correct. 

Will be uploading the code and different files in a while, stay tuned!
